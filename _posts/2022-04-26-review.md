## Review of ENGL 350

Throughout my time in [ENGL 350: Writing for the Digital Humanities](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/2022/engl350spring2022), I learned what it **truly** means to be a digital humanist and the ways in which this discipline can bring forth a deeper understanding of the world around us. The incorporation of interactivity and education in a digital humanities project can lend to a world in which we understand not just broad topics, but intricacies of time periods, people, and special interests. The Digital Humanities has grabbed my attention because of how accessible it is to people of all age groups, backgrounds, and hobbies. It is a field that can adapt itself to _anyone_ who cares enough to listen.

“Digital Humanities” was once a foreign term to me that I falsely described as a discipline that focuses on social media and online presence. I was pleasantly surprised by the intricacies that digital humanities holds. I now understand it as the convergence of education and accessible digital formatting to bring forth a new realm of learning that stems far past the generic lecture style. My definition has entirely changed, not only because of explanations we digested through readings such as [“What is Digital Humanities,”](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com) but also by venturing into various digital humanities resources. I now have a strong understanding of the field, based mostly in our ventures into the world of digital humanities.

There were two readings that helped me understand the Digital Humanities in a more holistic way. “For Beginners, What Makes a Good Digital Humanities Project?” and “Why Do Academics Have a Hard Time Writing Good Grant Proposals?”

[“For Beginners, What Makes a Good Digital Humanities Project?”](https://www.hastac.org/blogs/alok/2017/09/22/beginners-what-makes-good-dh-project) gave a detailed outline on what must be included in a digital humanities project to ensure optimal impact on an audience. Research, highlighting, and presentation were the top three facets of a project that caught my attention because they focused on what the author could do to ensure that the information they were presenting was easily digestible.

[“Why Do Academics Have a Hard Time Writing Good Grant Proposals?”](https://www.hastac.org/blogs/alok/2017/09/22/beginners-what-makes-good-dh-project) was very helpful as I was navigating the Grant Proposal Assignment because of my pre-established mindset that to write, your sentences must be complex and thorough. By learning that Grant Proposal requirements are very cut and dry, I was able to modify my writing style to answer all the questions designated in the prompt and add my own flair. I also had to learn how to be concise in my sentence structure. Specifically, I found the line “Length vs Brevity,” very helpful because it reminded me that less is more in a grant proposal. By being able to see specific mechanics that were necessary in a grant proposal, it was easier to modify my writing style.

I really enjoyed the blog posts because it gave me a chance to apply my small digital humanities knowledge such as base line coding while also being able to design personalized posts. I enjoyed learning markdown because it made me feel as though I could incorporate various aspects of interactivity to all of my blog posts. Specifically, the tutorial we used to explain the various types of markdown made it very easy to see the ways in which punctuation can change how phrases are displayed on the screen. It was fun to implement what we were learning in the classroom into our own projects.

Similarly, the blog posts were a fun way to show how we have processed the information we were learning. My favorite post was the TEI Blog Post because it gave me time to reflect on my experience coding an excerpt from "Dracula’s Guest." By giving me time to look back on what parts of the coding were hard and which took less time to work on, I was able to see which bits of coding I would need to work on in the future. The versatility of the blog posts, including the TEI Blog Post, allowed us to focus on various aspects of coding that stretched between different writing purposes.

I have grown as a writer through my ability to learn a new type of writing style. Because I am an English major, I often try to add ornamentation into everything I write. Specifically, using long, flowing sentences with in depth vocabulary has always been my go to. Through the use of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmmaFlye), blogging, and grant writing, I now see the importance of **conciseness** in writing. To be able to express a lot of ideas in a few words is a skill I _never_ thought I would have!

I have grown as a student through using various softwares that I was unfamiliar with. Specifically, Github and Oxygen. Having to navigate through these two softwares improved my ability to be patient in moments of confusion. Taking time to learn the intricacies of each software, rather than speeding through to get the work done, helped me to gain new skills that I otherwise would have sped through.

Now that I understand and find interest in the Digital Humanities, I have grown as a digital humanist. I see the importance of accessible and interactive resources to encourage the investigation of special topics. I will definitely take my understanding of the Digital Humanities with me once I leave school to my peers and show them how much they can learn through purely exploring.
