**_Project Overview:_**
[Navigating the Green Book](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/) (NGB) interprets the Green Book by Victor Green. The Green Book is a resource that highlights places African Americans could visit during vacations. The book indicates restaurants, lodging, and even bars that were integrated between the years 1947 and 1956. [The New York Public Library Labs](https://www.nypl.org/collections/labs) uses NGB to display implications of segregation. The author, [Victor Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo_Green), states “It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go wherever we please, and without embarrassment. But until that time comes we shall continue to publish this information for your convenience each year.” In this quote, Green sheds light on the restrictive circumstances of segregation. NGB sheds light on the implications that discrimination had on Americans before the Civil Rights Movement and allows for its audience to conceptualize the affects of racism in the 1940s through 1960s.

**_Project Review:_**

**Physical Layout:** 
NGB is easy to navigate and there is a clear organization of information to give context to the resource. On every page, there is a menu displaying the three resources in the site: [About This Project](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/index.html), [Map a Trip](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/trip.html), and [View Map](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/map.html#layer=cluster&year=1947). About This Project returns you to a concise and informative page, to help with the understanding of the purpose and overview of the project. Map a Trip holds an interactive experience of planning a trip in which you can state your point of departure and your destination. View Map grants the audience a full overview of the resources available to African Americans as they planned their trips. By clicking on the titles of each page on the bottom left of the screen, users can choose what section of the site they would like to explore.

**Data Visualization:**
The data visualizations in the site are generally easy to understand. In the section titled View Map, it is clear that the numbers placed on areas show how many integrated lodgings and restaurants are available. Once you click on these numbers on the map, the site will zoom into the selected region. Through this, you can see where safe lodgings and restaurants are located. The images on the website are high definition and easy to interpret.

**Accessibility:**
NGB is mobile friendly and operates well on all devices (cell phone, laptop, etc.). Though the screen is easier to read on a laptop, the resources are still available and accessible on mobile devices. All the links on the site are active, found by testing the hyperlinked text on the site. There was a large variety of the types of websites used. The links included databases, definitions, and twitter profiles of contributors. Through the inclusion of pertinent links, nuances of the website become easy to understand.

**Transcriptions:** 
Most of the transcription is easy to understand but there were some gray areas while looking at copies of the original Green Book. After you plan a trip, the site includes a photocopy of the page of the Green Book that lists the restaurants and lodgings available on the trip route. The site displays an entire page of the Green Book which can be confusing when attempting to find specific information. It would be easier to navigate if the lodgings that the website is referring to were highlighted. An example of this is in Musical Passage, a resource that displays songs sung by American slaves. This site highlights the text that the user indicates interest in.

**Conclusion:** 
The site is efficient, educational, and interactive. The site achieves its purpose of educating the public on the prominence of segregation while also displaying a credible primary source.
NGB is a great resource for people who find interest in investigating African American lifestyles in 1940-60.
