## Overview

For this project, I worked with an excerpt from [*Dracula’s Guest*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10150/10150-h/10150-h.htm) by Bram Stoker given to me by my professor and used Text Encoding Initiative [(TEI)](https://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/basicguide/TEI), standardized eXtensible Markup Language [(XML)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp) to markup the text. In my excerpt of *Dracula’s Guest*, the main character and his coachmen are at a crossroads, speaking of the tradition to bury people who had committed suicide where roads intersect. When they hear a half howl, half yelp from the forest, they are confused by its origin. Then, the coachman tells the main character of the unholy nature of the area they are standing in, based on a village that used to be housed there which explains the . 

While marking up the text, I used a Google Doc to indicate the various noteworthy aspects of my excerpt, making the conversion to Oxygen much easier. This was an interesting project because it made me more familiar with coding, showing me that coding, though it has a learning curve, is accessible to people of all skill levels.

## Markup in Google Docs

My excerpt is full of elements such as quotes, paragraphs, and page breaks which were easy to initially indicate on Google Docs. After I received my text, I went through and made comments on all of the places that would need to be marked up, highlighting the beginning and end of quotes, the beginning of paragraphs, em-dashes, and the ends of pages. By doing this, it was easier for me to see what parts of the text I would need to markup to effectively translate the plan Google Doc into code in Oxygen.

I am very familiar with Google Docs because I have used it since Google Drive was created at the end of my fifth grade year. I have learned the features that it holds throughout trial and error. Because of this, it took me only three or four minutes to highlight features of my text, allowing me ample time to explore Oxygen.

## Working with Oxygen

Once my professor began to walk us through the creation of a project in Oxygen, I was immediately overwhelmed. I have never worked with coding in this capacity before and I was very confused by the symbols and words that I was seeing on my screen. Once we created our individual projects and Dr. Stover explained the purpose of the different tags, it became much clearer. I understood that though there were symbols and arrangements of letters that I didn’t understand, by looking at key words such as **“title,”** **“body,”** and **“source,”** I was able to understand that the code was simply laid out like a document with key words indicating the parts of the text that should be placed under certain tags. Though there were symbols in between the paragraphs and sentences, their purposes were easy to understand such as the slash symbol meaning the end of a quote or paragraph. 

After gaining some understanding of the purpose of the tags, I copied and pasted my body text into the program. Thankfully, we had a guide on our class website to help us navigate the creation of markup such as showing examples of proper code and code that would be rejected.

Here is an example of valid code:

By seeing the reasons as to why code would be invalid, it was easier for me to figure out what I was doing incorrectly before I had to ask questions. Specifically, I struggled in putting the body of my text under the **“body”** section. Originally, I pasted it one indent too far over which resulted in the entire code being invalid. Because of the examples we had, I was able to fix this issue which exposed the true issues I had in my code by seeing what the body was supposed to look like. After I fixed the body of my text, the remainder of the code was much easier because of the simplicity of starting paragraphs with **“p”** and ending it with **“p/”** as well as beginning quotes with **“q”** and ending them with **“q/”**. Though daunting at first, marking up my text was easier than I originally thought it would be because some aspects of the code were able to explain themselves, such as **“p”** meaning paragraph and **“q”** meaning quote.

## Conclusion
	
Originally, I felt very overwhelmed when I first heard of the requirements of this process because of my lack of familiarity with coding. Thankfully, Dr. Stover did a great job of explaining how code works and made it easy for me to interpret. Now that I have worked in Oxygen, I am interested in learning more about different types of coding which can help me build my own Digital Humanities resources. This project has made me more comfortable with the idea of learning different types of programs which will widen my horizons as I pursue further Digital Humanities classes.
